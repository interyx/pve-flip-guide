# MPQ Flip Guide 

## Now, Just What Is A Flip?
Ok, let's start at the beginning.  PVE in MPQ is divided into five different time slices.  These are different for everyone around the world, so we usually just refer to them as "S1-S5" in the order they appear when you go to join an event.  When you enter a slice, you go into a "bracket" which is basically just a big room that contains everyone you're competing against.  When we refer to individual brackets we say [Slice #].[Clearance Level].  So for Slice 2 in SCL 9, we would say "2.9". 

PVE is very heavily incentivized for speed.  The first person who enters the room and gets the most points gets first place.  The second person to score the same amount of points gets second place.  For information about how to get the most points in every event, see my [PVE Guide](https://www.tinyurl.com/MPQ-PVE-GUIDE).   TL;DR don't clear everything straight through if you want the most points, start the timers first.

**This is hard to do**.  Chances are, if you're reading this, you don't have the kind of roster, or clearing strategy, that can compete with top PVE players in order to be faster than them and get a higher placement.  So how do you get higher placement for better rewards?  Don't play against them at all.

Each bracket only holds 1000 people.  When it fills up, a new bracket opens.  We call this the **flip**. That means, if you get in that room, you're competing with **fewer people** that are **less competitive** on average (if they were more competitive, they wouldn't have waited so long to join, right?).   That means higher placement!  Of course the top spots will probably still be quite competitive but this is an easy way to turn a top 100-200 score into a top 25-50 score very easily.  And the better you are at clearing, the higher placement you can get.

## But How Do I Get A Flip?

**First and most importantly, *Do not prejoin events!***

When the preview pane for the next event pops up, you can look at the rewards but **do not register for the event**.   Doing so will put you into the queue with a whole bunch of other players and you'll join the first bracket automatically with the stiffest competition.

There's nothing ingame that tells you how full different rooms are.  The only way you can see how full a bracket is is by being in that bracket.

Well, the good news is that the community has gotten together with a big network of players in different rooms that are reporting how many people are in that room.  By communicating that through LINE or a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g24uo61ITTveZrUGx4ZY5nMoJp-n1NCxq5r4WMhAJU0/edit#gid=0) other players can know how full each room is and what the optimal time is to join.

## Won't Joining Late Cost Me Points?
A few, yeah.  But a couple things to remember are:

**A) Everyone else in your room has also lost that many potential points** so you're not at a disadvantage that way.

**B) The first day has the fewest points in it** so you're not losing that many overall.

**C) The only alliances that are affected by losing that many points are T5-T10 playing SCL10**.  So don't worry about it!

**D) Anyone joining after you has lost more potential points than you.**  If you're clearing optimally there's literally no way for someone to catch up after even a few hours, so you want to join as soon as possible after the flip for the highest placement.
